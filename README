Python Script for locating and returning files within a given directory tree
that match at a binary data level.

Currently the algorithm is written to make use of file sizes and hashes to
determine if there is a match betweem files.  The reason for this choice is
mainly one of speed and the fact that the hashes generated offer a simple
common identifier by which the duplicates can be groups.

The algorithm as written is not fool proof as hash collisions are still
possible, this is the reason for the addition of the file sizes into the
identifying key.  This helps to mitigate the possibility of collisions but
does not completely handle it.

A further step that could be taken is, in the case of a collision on hash and
file size, actual contents of the colliding files can be examined.

Code along the lines of:

    def _compare_actual_contents(self, other):
        try:
            with open(self._file_path, 'rb') as this_file, \
                 open(other.file_path, 'rb') as other_file:
                for lines in zip(this_file, other_file):
                    if lines[0] != lines[1]:
                        return False
            return True
        except (AttributeError, TypeError, IOError):
            return False

could be used to achieve this.
